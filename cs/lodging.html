				<h4>Cabins and Divisions</h4>

				<p>Each cabin is team of 10 boys with two outstanding counselors to guide them through their journey at camp. Although our sisters in Girls Camp are a part of our Sequioa Family, at Boys Camp… <strong>no girls allowed</strong>!</p>

				<p>Boys Camp is separated based on age group, with three distinct divisions: <em>Junior Boys Camp (7-10 years-old), Intermediate Boys Camp (10-13 years-old), and Senior Boys Camp (13-17 years-old)</em>. Each division has age-appropriate policies and guidelines that provide a safe, nurturing environment for our campers. Our younger boys' cabins are located in Liberty City, near the center of camp, opposite to Girls Camp. Intermediate and Senior Boys' cabins begin as you travel further up the mountain with Intermediate Boys Camp residing on Hilltop and The Alamo, and Senior Boys Camp calling Tenny Top home.</p>

				<h4>Cabin Assignments</h4>

				<p>Specific cabin assignments are distributed by sex, age and grade within the division. Our mountain family is based on the principle of meeting new people and creating new friendships, thus encouraging campers to enter the summer with an open attitude. However, we do afford our campers the opportunity to request one cabin-mate.</p>

				<h4>Supervision</h4>

				<p>The cabin unit provides excellent supervision and role model leadership for our campers 24 hours a day. Campers and staff travel as a group to activities, meals and EPs. Boys at Sequoia look to their counselors as a role model and enjoy just being one of the guys.</p>

				<img src="images/girls_bunk.png" height="167" width="250" alt="Girls Bunk" class="alignright" />
				<h4>Cabins and Divisions</h4>

				<p>Each cabin in Girls Camp is a sisterhood of 10 girls led by two dynamic female counselors. This group will learn to live, learn, work and play as a group. Best part is... <strong>no boys allowed</strong>!</p>

				<p>All of Girls Camp is a family, but we have three age divisions on camp – <em>Senior Girls, who range in age from 13-17 years old, Intermediate Girls, ages 10-13 and our Junior Girls, ages 7-10</em>. Each division will have age appropriate policies, bed times, guidelines and even camper or activity privileges to provide a loving, safe environment for each camper. Our Senior Girls cabins are located near the heart of camp.</p>

				<h4>Cabin Assignments</h4>

				<p>Camp is a wonderful opportunity to make new friends for life, and we encourage our campers to embrace this benefit of camp. Campers feel welcomed by their cabinmates, who are the same age or grade. We do allow each camper one cabin request, that will be honored if possible.</p>

				<h4>Supervision</h4>

				<p>The cabin unit provides excellent supervision and role model leadership for our campers 24 hours a day. Campers and staff travel as a group to activities, meals and EPs. Campers view being with their counselors as a perk, learning from them and having a big sister to look up to.</p>
