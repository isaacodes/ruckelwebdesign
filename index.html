        <p>
            Web Design at Ruckel Middle School, located in portable 2, is a full-year course that offers students the
            ability to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as complete guided projects and independent projects
            during the school year. Instructed by Mrs. Marshall, the students will spend the first quarter (depending on
            the speed of the students) learning the basics of HTML and CSS, while completing a learning project called
            "Camp Sequoia", a fictional (for the purposes of the project) summer camp, that includes all of the elements
            and concepts that the students will be learning about.
        </p>
        <h2 id="certification">Certification</h2>
        <p>
            A big part of the class for the students is certifying. To certify, the student must take a special
            assessment designed by Microsoft on the basics of HTML and CSS. If the student passes the test (70% or
            higher), they will be considered certified and will be exempt from taking the EOC (end-of-course) exam. The
            certification grade will be entered as the exam grade*. The certification allows the student to stay after
            class if needed (although the test does have a time limit), so that the student may be guaranteed all of the
            alotted time to complete the test.

        <h2 id="projects">Student Projects</h2>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, the students enrolled in this course will be completing projects during the course
            of the year, with varying levels of guidance and restrictions from the instructor. Below you can find a
            complete list of the projects that the students will complete during the course of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Camp Sequoia</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project is the student's first taste of what coding in HTML and CSS is really like, in the
                        sense that this is their first project. During this project, the student will learn concepts and
                        elements of HTML and CSS while completing this guided project, reading instructions and
                        following them. The end product should look roughly like <a href="cs/index.html">this</a>
                        Upon completion of this project, the student will have learned the majority of HTML elements and
                        CSS concepts for the entire course.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Diamond Health Club</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project will be the second that the student completes. The project contains minor guidance,
                        as the student is given generic instructions such as "set the background of the body to
                        background.jpg, and make the background image repeat both horizontally and vertically." The
                        student then will have to figure out how to complete the task at hand to come up with the <a
                            href="dhc/index.html">end result</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Personal Project</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project is a very loose project, as the only input that the instructor has on the web page
                        and how it is made is the approval of a topic. Once the student has their topic approved, they
                        are allowed class time to construct their web page and upload it. At the end of the given
                        timeframe, the student will present the project to the class for a grade on both the
                        presentation, and the project itself.</li>
                </ul>
